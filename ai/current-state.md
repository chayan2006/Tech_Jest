# Current state snapshot

What the repository contains as of 23 October 2026. It does not prove that the live Supabase project or Vercel deployment match it: changes made in this session were verified on a local Supabase copy, not on production.

## Project purpose

TechJest is a Next.js marketing, lead-generation, and client-portal site for a software development company. Visitors browse services, build a project cart, and send enquiries (with or without an account). Clients get a private workspace with requests, proposals, projects, invoices, and messages. The team runs everything from an admin console.

Legal entity, final domain, and other business details are **UNKNOWN / NOT VERIFIED** (see `LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md`).

## Technology stack

- Next.js `^16.4.2` (App Router), React and React DOM `19.3.1`, TypeScript `5.8.2`
- `@supabase/ssr` `^0.12.7`, `@supabase/supabase-js` `^2.118.0`
- Vitest `5` (unit and API route tests), Playwright `1.64` (browser tests, using installed Google Chrome)
- Node.js `>=20` in `package.json`; `.nvmrc` pins `22.14.0` (Vitest 5 needs 22.12+)
- Plain global CSS in `src/app/globals.css`; no CSS framework
- Email through Resend's HTTP API (no SDK); off until configured

## Rendering and caching

- The root layout reads no session, so public pages (home, services, service pages, about, contact, cart, portfolio, privacy, terms, auth screens, sitemap) are prerendered and revalidated every 5 minutes (`s-maxage=300`). Saving in Admin → Website settings or Admin → Services calls `/api/admin/revalidate`, which refreshes them at once.
- Public data comes from `backend/supabase/public.ts` (no cookies). Pages that read the session (dashboard, messages, project, admin) render per request.
- `frontend/components/account.tsx` (`AccountProvider`) reads the session in the browser for the header only: profile badge, Login link, mobile menu, and the notification bell (`unread_message_counts()` plus unread admin notifications). Message threads dispatch `UNREAD_EVENT` so the bell recounts.
- The intro video renders only on `/` and `/opening_animation_video`.

## Authentication and authorization

- Supabase Auth: email/password, Google OAuth, and password reset (`/auth` → email → `/auth/callback?next=/auth/reset` → `/auth/reset`).
- The project signs tokens with an ES256 key. `getSessionUser()` (`backend/supabase/session.ts`) and the proxy use `getClaims()`, which verifies tokens locally. Role changes apply when a token refreshes (within an hour), the same moment row-level security sees them.
- Admins have `app_metadata.role = 'admin'`. `requireAdmin()` / `getAdminForApi()` (`backend/supabase/admin.ts`) guard admin pages and routes; row-level security enforces the same in the database.
- Sign-ups and logins (including Google and password reset) are written to `audit_logs` by the `record_auth_event` trigger on `auth.users`; browsers cannot write there.

## Main flows

### Enquiries

`POST /api/contact` (contact form and cart):

1. Drops submissions that fill the hidden `website` field (looks successful to bots).
2. Validates service, message (20–5000 characters), contact fields, and cart service slugs against the catalog.
3. Signed in: `submit_project_request()` saves the request, its services, a conversation, the first message, and an admin notification in one transaction. A trigger limits each client to 10 requests an hour.
4. Signed out: `submit_guest_request()` saves a guest request (no account, no conversation) after re-checking every field; names and prices come from the catalog; 3 per email and 50 in total per hour.
5. After the response, `after()` emails the team (Resend), with Reply-To set to the client.

The cart keeps selected slugs in `localStorage` (`techjest-service-cart`); a half-written quote or contact form is kept while the visitor chooses to log in.

### Client workspace

- `/dashboard`: "Needs your attention" (unread messages, proposals to answer, invoices due), profile details (editable name, phone, purpose), projects with tasks, and request history with proposals.
- Proposals marked Sent show Accept/Decline (`POST /api/proposals/[id]/respond` → `respond_to_proposal()`): once only, by the owning client, before `valid_until`. The team gets a notification, an email, and a note in the conversation; accepting sets the lead stage to `won`.
- `/messages` and `/project/[id]`: conversations (polling every 15 s plus Supabase Realtime), tasks, documents (signed download links), and non-draft invoices.

### Admin console

Overview, notifications, messages, requests (paged, 25 per page), CRM pipeline, proposals, projects (tasks, invoices, documents), invoices, people (paged), services catalog editor, website settings, and activity log. Every status is editable from the console. Guest requests are labelled "reply by email". On phones the console starts with its tab row; create forms fold away once their list has items.

### Email

`backend/email/team-alert.ts`: team alerts for new requests, client messages, and proposal answers (needs `RESEND_API_KEY` and `ALERT_EMAIL_TO`); client emails when the team replies (also needs `ALERT_EMAIL_FROM` on a domain verified in Resend).

## Database

`backend/supabase/schema.sql` (safe to rerun) defines companies, profiles, project requests (with guest rows where `user_id` is null), request services, audit logs, proposals, projects, tasks, project messages, documents (plus the private `project-documents` storage bucket), invoices, the service catalog, admin notifications, conversations, participants, messages, and site settings, with row-level security on every table. Functions: `handle_new_user`, `record_auth_event`, `touch_conversation_on_message`, `admin_delete_user_data`, `submit_project_request`, `submit_guest_request`, `limit_project_requests`, `unread_message_counts`, `respond_to_proposal`.

Existing databases apply the dated files in `backend/supabase/migrations/` in name order. As of 23 October 2026 the owner had applied everything up to and including `2026-10-22-security-hardening.sql`; `2026-10-23-reliability-and-guest-enquiries.sql` must run before the matching code is deployed.

## Environment

See `.env.example`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CONTACT_EMAIL` and `WHATSAPP_NUMBER` (fallbacks for Admin → Website settings), `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ALERT_EMAIL_TO`, `ALERT_EMAIL_FROM`. `SUPABASE_JWKS_URL` is documented but not read. Never add the Supabase secret key to the app.

`next.config.ts` sets security headers and reads `NEXT_DIST_DIR` (the browser tests build into `.next-e2e`). `vercel.json` pins server functions to Mumbai (`bom1`).

## Verification

- `npm run check`: typecheck, Vitest (41 tests), Prettier, production build.
- `npm run e2e:db` then `npm run test:e2e`: 34 Playwright tests against a throwaway local Supabase (Docker); the config refuses any non-local database.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs both on every pull request and push to `main`; Vercel deploys `main`.
