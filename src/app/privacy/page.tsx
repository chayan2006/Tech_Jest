          <h2>Information we collect</h2>
          <p>
            When you send a project enquiry, request a quote, or message us, we collect the details you enter: your
            name, email, phone number, company, budget, timeline, and project description. If you create an account, we
            also store your sign-in details and the project history linked to it.

          <h2>How we use it</h2>
          <p>
            We use this information to reply to you, prepare proposals, deliver projects, and keep your project history
            in your private dashboard. We do not sell your personal information.
          </p>
          <h2>Who can see it</h2>
          <p>
            Your enquiries and project data are visible to the TechJest team. We use trusted providers to host the
            website and store data, and they process it only to provide those services. We share information with
            others only where the law requires it.
          </p>
          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            We use only the cookies and browser storage needed to keep you signed in and to remember the services in
            your project cart.
          </p>
          <h2>Your choices</h2>
          <p>
            You can ask us to access, correct, or delete your personal information at any time by emailing{" "}
            <a href={`mailto:${email}`}>{email}</a>. We keep project records for as long as needed to deliver the work
            and meet legal obligations.
          </p>
